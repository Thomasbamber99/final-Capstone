Inventory OOP project
_____________________

This project was created as an introduction to working with classes and works with the .txt file 'inventory.txt",
The python file and the text file both work together to simulate a business operating in numerous different countries
with a database of different types of shoes, using the program the user is able to display and call upon different 
types of information such as searching for a specific shoe type, view all, viewing the values of each item
and even updating the database using the re_stock function to ammend the quantities of shoes listed in the txt file.

Installation section

into the same folder, once you have done this you can run the .py file using any code editor. press f5 to run the
program and once you are presented with the menu, first select option 1 to read from the text file. This will
intialise the database and then you can proceed to work with the file. Make sure python is installed on your computer
